		<div class="text">Welcome to The Design Village! If you’re already thinking what kind of an unusual name that is for a design college, trust us we’ve been there. It takes some getting used to seeing life through design, but once we do, the metaphor of the village realizes itself for us, both in physicality and philosophy and we become the villagers for life. We hope to give you a peep into what goes on at the Village, some village stories crafted by some of the villagers for you to feel like a part of the community because now that you’re here, you are.</div>
